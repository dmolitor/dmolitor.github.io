My research interests are centered in the Computational Social Sciences and I have a particular interest in causal inference and how computational methods can help us do better causal inference. On the side, I love open source software and enjoy building tools and learning new technologies whenever I can. I’m very thankful to have my work supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship!\n\nYou can access my CV here."
