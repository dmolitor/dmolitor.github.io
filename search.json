I am particularly interested in how we can apply computational and Machine Learning methods to uncovering and estimating these causal relationships. I’m a first-year PhD student at Cornell’s School of Information Science. My interests are centered broadly in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Causal Inference. I’m a big fan of working with and developing open source software."
