<p>
Hello there! I'm a second-year PhD student at Cornell's School of Information Science. My research
interests are centered in the Computational Social Sciences and I have a particular interest
in causal inference and how computational methods can help us do better causal inference. On the
side, I love open source software and enjoy building tools and learning new technologies whenever I can.
I'm very thankful to have my work <a href=https://gradschool.cornell.edu/spotlights/student-spotlight-daniel-molitor/>supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>!

<p>You can access my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rFz-q_Sw29GhW20zp67P_rlnt6XXDG6N/view?usp=sharing">CV here</a>.</p>
