            Experimental researchers in political science frequently face the problem of inferring which of several treatment arms is most effective. They may also seek to estimate mean outcomes under that arm, construct confidence intervals, and test hypotheses. Ordinarily, multiarm trials conducted using static designs assign participants to each arm with fixed probabilities. However, a growing statistical literature suggests that adaptive experimental designs that dynamically allocate larger assignment probabilities to more promising treatments are better equipped to discover the best performing arm. Using simulations and empirical applications, we explore the conditions under which such designs hasten the discovery of superior treatments and improve the precision with which their effects are estimated. Recognizing that many scholars seek to assess performance relative to a control condition, we also develop and implement a novel adaptive algorithm that seeks to maximize the precision with which the largest treatment effect is estimated

	abstract = {In experiments, researchers commonly allocate subjects randomly and equally to the different treatment conditions before the experiment starts. While this approach is intuitive, it means that new information gathered during the experiment is not utilized until after the experiment has ended. Based on methodological approaches from other scientific disciplines such as computer science and medicine, we suggest machine learning algorithms for subject allocation in experiments. Specifically, we discuss a Bayesian multi-armed bandit algorithm for randomized controlled trials and use Monte Carlo simulations to compare its efficiency with randomized controlled trials that have a fixed and balanced subject allocation. Our findings indicate that a randomized allocation based on Bayesian multi-armed bandits is more efficient and ethical in most settings. We develop recommendations for researchers and discuss the limitations of our approach.},

              conjoint analysis
              , an experimental design yet to be widely applied in political science, enables researchers to estimate the causal effects of multiple treatment components and assess several causal hypotheses simultaneously. In conjoint analysis, respondents score a set of alternatives, where each has randomly varied attributes. Here, we undertake a formal identification analysis to integrate conjoint analysis with the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. We propose a new causal estimand and show that it can be nonparametrically identified and easily estimated from conjoint data using a fully randomized design. The analysis enables us to propose diagnostic checks for the identification assumptions. We then demonstrate the value of these techniques through empirical applications to voter decision making and attitudes toward immigrants.},
