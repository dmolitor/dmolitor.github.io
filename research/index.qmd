    Contemporary social mobility research often adopts an ostensibly descriptive
    goal: to document associations between parent and child socioeconomic outcomes and their
    variation over time and place. To complement descriptive research, we adopt a causal
    goal: to estimate the degree to which parent occupation causes child occupation. We
    formalize this causal goal in the potential outcomes framework to define precise 
    counterfactuals. We highlight a difficulty connected to the positivity assumption for causal
    inference: when the treatment is parent occupation, many counterfactuals never happen in
    observed data. Parents without college degrees are never employed as physicians,
    for instance. We show how to select causal estimands involving only the
    counterfactuals that can be studied with data. We demonstrate our approach using 
    the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979. Our causal approach points to 
    open questions about how specific aspects of family background, such as 
    parent occupation, causally shape the life chances of children.

    The mismatch between the skills that employers seek and the skills that workers possess
    will increase substantially as demand for technically skilled workers accelerates.
    Skill mismatches disproportionately affect low-income workers and those within
    industries where relative demand growth for technical skills is strongest.
    As a result, much emphasis is placed on reskilling workers to ease transitions
    into new careers. However, utilization of training programs may be sub-optimal
    if workers are uncertain about the returns to their investment in training.
    While the U.S. spends billions of dollars annually on reskilling programs and
    unemployment insurance, there are few measures of program effectiveness that
    workers or government can use to guide training investment and ensure valuable
    reskilling outcomes. We demonstrate a causal machine learning method for
    estimating the value-added returns to training programs in Rhode Island, where
    enrollment increases future quarterly earnings by $605 on average, ranging from
    -$1,570 to $3,470 for individual programs. In a nationwide survey (N=2,014),
    workers prefer information on the value-added returns to earnings following
    training enrollment, establishing the importance of our estimates for guiding
    training decisions. For every 10% increase in expected earnings, workers are
    17.4% more likely to express interest in training. State and local governments
    can provide this preferred information on value-added returns using our method
    and existing administrative data.

    The COVID-19 public health emergency caused widespread economic shutdown and 
    unemployment. The resulting surge in Unemployment Insurance claims threatened to
    overwhelm the legacy systems state workforce agencies rely on to collect,
    process, and pay claims. In Rhode Island, we developed a scalable cloud
    solution to collect Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims as part of a
    new program created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic
    Security Act to extend unemployment benefits to independent contractors
    and gig-economy workers not covered by traditional Unemployment Insurance.
    Our new system was developed, tested, and deployed within 10 days following
    the passage of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, making
    Rhode Island the first state in the nation to collect, validate, and pay
    Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims. A cloud-enhanced interactive voice
    response system was deployed a week later to handle the corresponding surge
    in weekly certifications for continuing unemployment benefits. Cloud solutions
    can augment legacy systems by offloading processes that are more efficiently
    handled in modern scalable systems, reserving the limited resources of
    legacy systems for what they were originally designed. This agile use of
    combined technologies allowed Rhode Island to deliver timely Pandemic
    Unemployment Assistance benefits with an estimated cost savings of
    $502,000 (representing a 411% return on investment).
