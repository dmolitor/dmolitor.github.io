I am currently a Pre-Doctoral Research Fellow at RIPL. My work has primarily 
revolved around reskilling and the labor force; applying causal machine learning
methods to evaluating existing reskilling methods, such as labor training 
programs, and developing tools to help people identify and achieve success in 
high-demand occupations that fit their skillsets.
