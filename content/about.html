<p>I am currently a pre-doctoral research fellow at <a href="https://www.ripl.org">RIPL</a>. My work has primarily revolved around reskilling and the labor force; both evaluting existing reskilling methods, such as labor training programs, and developing tools to help people identify and acheive success in high-demand occupations that fit their skillsets.</p>
<p>I like working with and making open source software in general, but am particularly interested in all things R. To see some of the projects that Iâ€™ve worked on, check out my <a href="https://github.com/dmolitor">Github</a>!</p>
